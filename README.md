# Dawaya Project
The project aims to create a platform (website and mobile app) that allows users to search for medications that are currently hard to find in the market. The platform will help users locate the nearest pharmacy that has the required medication in stock, thus saving time and providing critical access to necessary drugs.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
